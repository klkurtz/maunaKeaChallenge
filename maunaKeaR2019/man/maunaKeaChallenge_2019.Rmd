```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = getwd())

load("../data/TrainingSet_20aimVO.rda")

```

## Input data

We have images from 61 patients.
Each image is a 2D matrix x_i_p where i is an index ranging from 0 to the number of images acquired from partient p.  
patient = p  
i from 0 to n = number of images from patient p

Interesting description from the data description:  
"The rationale for including a patient index is that there might be some level of correlation
between images acquired from one single patient which is larger than from two different
patients."

## Output data

we have four classes:  
0 = “Squamous_Epithelium”  
1 = “Intestinal_metaplasia”  
2 = “Gastric_metaplasia”  
3 = “Dysplasia_and_Cancer”  

They guarantee that if an image acquired from a patient is in the training set, there is no image
acquired from the same patient in any test sets.

## Metric

Non weighted Multiclass accuracy =
(Number of images in the test set automatically assigned to the correct class) /
(Number of images in the test set)


## Picture and patient numbers

We just wanted to know how many pictures each patiens has and which picture number occurs most often.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#getwd()


p <- ggplot(TrainingSet_20aimVO, aes(x=patientNumber))+
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
     ylab("Number of pictures")+
     xlim(0,60)+
     ggtitle("Training set")


q <- ggplot(test_data_order, aes(x=patientNumber))+
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
     ylab("Number of pictures")+
     xlim(0,60)+
     ggtitle("Test set")

grid.arrange(p, q)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(TrainingSet_20aimVO, aes(x=imageNumber))+
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
     ylab("Number of patients")+
     ggtitle("Training set")

q <- ggplot(test_data_order, aes(x=imageNumber))+
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
     ylab("Number of patients")+
     xlim(0, 644)+
     ggtitle("Test set")

grid.arrange(p, q)
```

We are also interested if all pictures of a patient have the same label?


```{r, echo=FALSE}

p <- ggplot(TrainingSet_20aimVO, aes(x=class_number))+
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
     facet_wrap(~patientNumber)
p

```

Patient number 12, 32 and 51 contain labels 2 and 3.  
Patient number 11 contains labels 1 and 2.  
Patient number 53 contains labels 2 and 4.  
The other 39 patients only have one label assigned.
